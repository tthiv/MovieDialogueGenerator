--is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there? Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes. Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days. Yeah, I   mean, it's different each day, so   I really like that. I don't think I   could ever work in an office.   Behind a desk.  Everyday.  I'm sorry. Did I bring what? Yes ma'am. I've been using it as a journal, but also a joke diary. Funny thoughts or, or observations-- Did I tell you I'm pursuing a career in stand-up comedy? I think I did. Right. I didn't realize you wanted to read it. Yeah. I mean, that's just-- No. I just,-- some of it's personal. You know? She has good days. But mostly bad. It's been a big help having me there. She really needs me.  Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I was in the hospital, after my last episode-- she was having trouble getting over there to visit. Yeah, I was wondering if you could ask the doctor to increase the dosage on my medications? Nothing seems to make a difference.  Some. She glances at his file again. I just don't wanna feel so bad anymore. I wasn't bothering her, I was-- It's day to day. I'm doing everything I can to get her back on her feet.  Picked up her medicine. Gonna make her some dinner.  Hey Sophie-- She turns around. I'll tell my mom you said hello. She smiles as in "yeah, that's what I said." Old apartment, worn carpet. Nothing's new inside but it's fairly neat and well-kept. Joker closes the door behind him, leans his back against it and swoons. Hears a deep purring sound. He looks down and sees an OLD ORANGE CAT, rubbing up against his leg. Then-- Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter. Yes I'm sure. And my head's right here. I'm gonna make you some dinner, okay? He's a busy man. Ma, eat. You need to eat. Maybe you shouldn't watch so much television.  Everybody who? Who do you talk to? Stop it. He's not even gonna run. Why would Thomas Wayne want to be mayor? He can do more good as a businessman. He will. Now eat some dinner. How you feeling today?  Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a werewolf? What? Why? Who tips their mailman? Okay. I can try his office. Tomorrow. Hello. I have a personal letter for Mr. Thomas Wayne. It's kind of important. I need to make sure he gets it himself. Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to years. She was their housekeeper. A couple other business people are now waiting behind Joker, there for meetings. Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe at least call back to him? Tell him that I'm here. Okay. Well, can I have your name? So I know who I left it with. Now Joker sees a GROUP OF MEN walking behind the glass that separates the reception area from the back offices. Amongst tan, hair dyed so black it's almost blue. Wait. He's right there.  Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne. He starts banging on the glass... but the group keeps moving. Not noticing him. It was just a bunch of kids. I should have left it alone.  My mother says that the people nowadays lack empathy. It means like "feeling for other people." Kind of. But different. I, I don't have the money for this, Randall. What for? Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to see me? Not quite. Haven't even performed yet. Just been working my material. This business is all about fine- tuning. Now Hoyt looks up. Takes a drag from his cigarette. No. I got jumped. I told you about that.  I don't have his sign. And Joker just stares at Hoyt, some blood forming on his forehead-- They wouldn't let me see him.  But they promised me it would get to him. Look up. She tilts her head back and he rinses her hair with the water from the container... Why are these letters so important to you, Ma? What do you think he's gonna do? Help us how? ago. What makes you think he would help you? She looks at him with conviction. I don't want you worrying about money. Everyone's been telling me they think my stand-up is ready for the big clubs. It's just a matter of time before I get a break. She steps into the towel. He's helping dry her off. What do you mean? What?! He quickly turns up the TV volume. REALLY LOUD. Shoves the still smoking gun under the couch cushions. I'M WATCHING AN OLD WAR MOVIE. I know. The Americans are really giving it to the Japs. He walks over to her in the darkness. Kisses her on the forehead.  I'm sorry. I'll turn it down. Joker is writing in his journal. He speaks softly to himself as he writes... Why didn't Randall tell me the gun was loaded? He's my friend. With my luck, I could have killed someone.  I could have killed myself.  I should have killed myself.  I should kill myself. Beat. Hello. I'd like to open an account. She looks up. Oh, hi. That's weird.  I didn't know you worked at a bank. Very glamorous. Look at this place. I'm a comedian. I do stand-up comedy. Yeah. You know, I'm always making funny observations. Always on the look out for my next bit-- so it makes sense. I said hi to my mom. Last week. You said to say hi to my mom. I did. Made her day.  Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you as well, Miss. Joker walks back to the wall by the forms. He fumbles around for a minute, clearly not there to open an account. He begins filling out a form. Then--  If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet. Joker and the kids stomp and sing along. If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet.  If you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it, if you're happy and you know it stomp your feet. As the song winds down, the KIDS and NURSES clap. Joker takes an exaggerated and ridiculous bow-- pants and slides across the floor. Everyone stops. Looks at the gun on the floor. Joker is on a payphone in the lobby of the hospital. He's in his street clothes, wig in his hand, clown-face still painted on.  Hoyt, let me explain.  It was, it was a prop gun. It's part of my act now.  Randall told you that?  Hoyt--  Say what?  --I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.  I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.  Please. Don't. Nothing. I have a condition-- No. It's just my stuff. I don't have anything. Hi. Do you like to laugh? Water dripping, white grease paint running off his face-- Remember how I told you that I'm a stand-up comedian?  Hi. How are you? Beat. Joker enters his building with great urgency. No time for the elevator, he takes the stairs. Two at a time. He races up the stairwell. When he gets to his floor, instead of making a left toward his apartment-- He makes a right, toward Sophie's. He stops at her door. Out of breath. Knocks. He hears footsteps. Quickly pulls the folded-up flyer out of his pocket. The peephole in the door goes dark and then light again. He hears locks unlocking. Sophie opens the door halfway-- Joker looks down at his feet-- Hi. Do you like to laugh?  Remember the other day when I told you about my stand-up comedy. Well, I'm doing a set next Thursday and I'm inviting a bunch of my friends and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come and check it out. Were you crying? Why are you crying? I'm sorry. I, I didn't-- What happened? What for?  Okay. Well, all the info is right there on the flyer. You know they say laughter is the best medicine. Well I didn't think you were going to read it. I lied. Everything bothers me. It's personal. It's my private thoughts. Plus it contains original comedy material that I don't feel comfortable handing over to you. She looks at him and shakes her head. Not in the mood to deal with this. So where will we be meeting? Okay. How am I gonna get my medication? Beat. Why are they talking to him?  -- good evening, hello.  Good to be here.  I, I hated school as a kid. But my mother would always say,--  "You should enjoy it. One day you'll have to work for a living."  "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!" Dead silence. Except for Joker, who's still cracking up. So, did you laugh? Really couldn't see much from up there. All I heard was my heart pounding. What friends?  Yeah, I decided not to invite them. As a performer sometimes you want to see how a "real" crowd reacts. People who don't already love me, or, or have a notion of who I am, you know? Yeah,-- I don't know how something like that happens. You think?  Hey. You want to get some coffee? I don't know. Not all of them are awful. Take someone like Thomas Wayne for example. He's a hero. Sophie, he's the only one who can save this city. What happened? With your job. At the bank? We don't have to talk about it. Every time.  Every time.  Did you do it? Did you go to bed with him? Right. Wait, what do you mean?  I'm sorry. I have this thing-- I don't know. I read you can get it from a brain injury or, or a lesion in there. My mom said I was born this way. Born laughing. Kind of. That actually started when I was a kid. The other kids made fun of me, called me Happy-- but not in a good way. I got so sick of it, one day when I was about ten, I, I,-- He smiles. I took a razor and cut this smile onto my face.  Sort of like "You want happy? Here, how's this for happy?" He looks down, still smiling. She just watches him for a beat. I've been thinking about this night my whole life. They just sit there for a beat. Quiet. Joker opening the door to his mother's apartment, holding a doggie bag in his hand, sees the flickering blue light of the  "That's life." What is this? How come you never told me? How could you not tell me, Ma?    I'm not yelling! I'm just, excited. How can any of this be real!? How can Thomas Wayne be my father?  Okay. How's this, Mom? Better? Will you please talk to me? Please.  What would they say, Ma? It was a prop gun. And I didn't pull it out, it fell out. Why don't you ask Randall about it? It was his idea. What? ... I don't know anything about it. Randall, I didn't shoot anybody. That wasn't me. And I don't have time for this, I got somebody real important I gotta go see. Joker turns to go--  What? What are you talking about? Randall. Your nose. My name's Arthur. I'm here to see Mr. Wayne-- I, I was just trying to make him laugh. No, please. My mother's name is Penny Fleck. She used to work here, years ago. Can you tell Mr. Wayne that I need to see him? Did you know her? You don't need to cover for them. I'm sure Mrs. Wayne was very upset when she found out. No. No, just let me speak to Mr. Wayne. Now Alfred leans in closer to Joker, almost looks like he feels some pity for him--  Thomas Wayne is my father-- Alfred looks at Joker, and can't help but crack up laughing at him. You did this to her? DET. GARRITY What? No. We just asked her some questions and she started getting hysterical-- hyperventilating, trouble speaking-- then she collapsed. Hit her head pretty hard. They told me she had a stroke. DET. GARRITY Sorry to hear that.  No I,-- I have a, a-- DET. BURKE Okay. But we have some questions for you. DET. GARRITY About those subway killings from a few weeks ago. I don't know anything about that. DET. GARRITY We have an eyewitness who described clown make up. Or a clown mask. Spoke to your boss at Ha-Ha's, Mr. Vaughn, and he said you were on a job the day of the shooting. DET. GARRITY  He also said you got fired that day,-- For bringing a gun into the children's hospital. DET. GARRITY You weren't fired? Not for having a gun. That was prop gun. Part of my act. DET. BURKE So why were you fired? They said I wasn't funny. Joker stands up. Now, if you don't mind, I have to go back and look after my mother. Detective Burke steps close to him, holds up the card that Joker handed him-- DET. BURKE Hey lemme ask you a question? This condition of yours,-- Is this real or is this like some sorta clown thing? Clown thing? DET. BURKE I mean, is it part of your act? What do you think? And Joker walks away-- heads for the sliding glass doors. Only the motion detector doesn't engage-- Excuse me, I was wondering how I could check my mother out of here? One of the nurses at the desk looks up at him, seems slightly annoyed. Penny Fleck. I'd like to take her home. She's not gonna wanna stay that long. She doesn't like hospitals. Or doctors. I don't like hospitals either. Okay. Thanks. Symptoms? Can you tell me what those symptoms are again? Excuse me? No, sorry. Wasn't me. I don't know what you're talking about. If I were you, I'd walk away from this table before I strangle all three of you with that fucking stethoscope hanging from your neck. Beat. Joker crosses a busy street heading to the Center for Performing Arts. Light falling. Storm clouds gathering. Joker stops when he sees-- A CROWD OF PROTESTERS SCREAMING AND SHOUTING IN FRONT OF What? Yeah. No I, I-- Dad. It's me. My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son.  I know you didn't know about me, and I don't want anything from you. Well... maybe a hug. Yes. But they wouldn't let me in, wouldn't let me see you. So I came here. I have so many questions. How do you know? No. What? I wasn't adopted. No. No, I don't believe that.  No, no I have a con-- Sophie? Can I ask you a question? How does someone wind up in here? Have all these people committed crimes?  Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes I don't know what to do, y'know, I don't think I can take any more of this. Last time I ended up taking it out on some,-- people. Bad shit. I thought it would bother me but, it really hasn't. It's just so hard to try and be happy all the time, y'know, when everything's going to shit all around you.  Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was just talking to talk.  So she was a patient here. What? I can handle bad. I've been on a pretty bad run myself. No, wait,-- Sophie, we can get through this, that's why I'm here. I don't know. I mean I've never been with a woman "like that," but, this feels like a beginning to me. You what? What? What kind of woman are you? Who does that?  Why not? No. Don't listen to her GiGi, you need to hear this. Your mother's a bad person. She's a whore, she's seeing two men at once. You can't trust her,-- She'll break your fucking heart. How come nothing ever comes easy for me?  Who is this?  Yes.  Murray wants me to come on the show? Ma, remember how you used to tell me that God gave me this laugh for a reason. That I had a purpose. To bring laughter and joy into this fucked up world,-- She looks at him confused. HA! It wasn't God, it was you or, or one of your boyfriends,-- how could you let that happen? What kind of woman are you? What kind of mother are you? She looks away. What's my real name? Her whole body is shaking, overwhelmed with emotion. C'mon, Ma, I know I was adopted. What's my name? Who am I really? She looks back him, struggles to speak--   But you know what's funny? You know what really makes me laugh? Leans down closer, face-to-face with her-- I used to think my life was nothing but a tragedy, but now, now I realize it's all just a fucking comedy. Other side of the blue divider curtain. We see Joker's feet shifting a little. You wanna hear a joke, Murray? He "waits" for Murray to answer. Then Joker nods okay and opens his notebook--  Knock-knock. His cat still watching him, now at his feet. Joker crosses and uncrosses his legs... Looks uncomfortable. He glances down at his cat. It's as if he can hear the cat talking to him.  Yeah, I don't know if I should cross or uncross 'em. Both feel completely unnatural. Joker gets up off the couch and walks back across the living room. Waves to the "audience"... Mimes shaking Murray's hand... Mimes unbuttoning his coat and sits down... Crosses his legs. Thanks for having me on, Murray. I can't tell you how much this means to me, it's been a life long dream. I have a joke for you-- Joker stands back up. Looks down at the cat again. You're right. You're right, uncrossed is better. Joker sits back down... Doesn't cross his legs this time.  You shouldn't be here. It's not right. DET. GARRITY We just came to pay our respects. Sorry about your mother. DET. BURKE Yeah, it's too bad. Joker just stares at the two detectives. Awkward beat. DET. BURKE Where is everybody? It's always been just me and her. Joker pauses for a moment, then starts to walk away. DET. BURKE  We saw you on Murray Franklin. Joker turns back to them. You saw that? DET. GARRITY Yeah. Heard you were on, so we got a videotape. DET. BURKE I just couldn't tell if you were actually trying to be funny or not. Yeah, well I guess you didn't get the joke. DET. GARRITY Listen, we need to clear a few things up, we spoke to the hospital administrator--  Which hospital? DET. BURKE The Children's Hospital.  The night you were fired. He said it didn't look like a prop gun, it was heavy, like a real one. We have some more questions for you. I just buried my mother. The detectives share a look. Garrity pulls out a card. Hands it to Joker. DET. GARRITY We can do it tomorrow. But you need to come down to the precinct-- first thing in the morning.  Right. Thanks for coming. DET. BURKE Of course. Joker looks back up. That was a joke. We hear applause followed by the familiar opening riff to Is that today? My mom died.  It's not a good time. I'm in the middle of something here.  I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Can you believe it? Gary doesn't answer. Doesn't move-- It's okay, Gary. You can go. Gary backs away toward the door. Joker sits there for a moment, breathing heavy, wipes Randall's blood off his face--  Murray, I can't believe this is real, that I'm really here. Are you kidding? Thank you for the opportunity. I've been watching you forever. My mother never missed a show. No, I don't believe in any of that. I don't believe in anything. I just thought it would be good for my act. No. I hadn't heard. Thank you Murray. Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When you bring me out, can you introduce me as "The Joker"? Honestly, I don't even know what my real name is. Besides, that's what you called me on the show, Murray. A joker. Remember?  Yeah. Isn't it great? Joker just keeps cracking up. Audience still isn't sure what to make of him. There's some awkward laughter. Nobody's laughing in the booth.  That's right. I'm not political, Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to make people laugh.  Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.  I want to get it right. Knock knock.  It's the police, ma'am. Your son has been hit by a drunk driver. He's dead. The associate producer tries not to laugh, but she can't help it. The director looks over at her like she's lost her mind. That's right, Murray. But she's dead now. The audience laughs. Yeah. She is. Murray's not sure if this is part of his act. I don't know who my father is, Murray. Turns out I was adopted and sexually assaulted by my mother's boyfriend. DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN Ahhhh! No, no,-- You can not joke about that.  Sorry. It's been a rough few months, Murray. I mean, after my mother died, the police came to question me at her funeral. Who does that? Very funny, Murray. No, they came because I killed those three Wall Street guys. Studio audience can't tell if he's joking or not. Murray can't either. There is no punchline. It's not a joke. The director stares at the monitor.  I got nothing left to lose, Murray. Nothing can hurt me anymore. This is my fate, it was always my fate. My life is nothing but a comedy. Sophie's sitting on her couch watching this interview play out on TV. GiGi's asleep next to her. The open envelope and the money are lying on the coffee table. No sign of the flowers anywhere. C'mon, Murray, do I look like the kind of clown who could start a movement? I killed those guys because they were awful. Everybody's awful these days. It's enough to make anyone crazy. No. They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives. Why is everyone so upset about these guys? Because Thomas Wayne went and cried about them on TV? Yeah. I do. Everything comes so easy for him. Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray? Do you ever actually leave the studio? Everybody just yells and screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy. You think men like Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever think what it's like to be a guy like me? To be anybody but themselves.  They don't. They think we'll all just sit there and take it like good little boys. That we won't werewolf and go wild. Well, this is for all of you out there. You're awful, Murray. There is no more laughter. The audience is watching this exchange with full attention. Playing my video, inviting me on the show,-- You just wanted to make fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh at Frankenstein on a crowded beach, isn't it? You're just like the rest of them, Murray. Everything comes too easy for you. How about another joke, Murray? What do you get when you cross a mentally-ill loner with a system that abandons him and treats him like trash? Murray pauses for a minute, not really listening to Joker, suddenly realizing the seriousness of the situation. He starts to turn to camera--  I'll tell you what you get. You get what you fucking deserve,-- And as Murray Franklin turns back to him, JOKER SHOOTS THE -- just thinking of this joke. No. Because it's personal, it's between me and him.  ... Good. Everything's good now.  Yeah. How I remember it.  Gotham City.  It always brings a smile to my face. Watch it, Batman.  Wait'll they get a load of me. You wouldn't believe what happened to me today. Because life's been good to me. Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands... and that's it. Yeah. Carmine got a little hot under the collar.  Haven't you heard of the healing power of laughter? Now GET OUT OF HERE -- And give it some thought. Bob, I want you to take a camera and follow this reporter Knox. Find out what he knows about Batman.  You got to learn to USE people, Bob. Your pals, they're not such bad guys.  What d'you say we give 'em a couple of days to come round?  No?  Grease 'em now?  Okay.  You're a vicious bastard, Rotelli. I'm glad you're dead.  Hello, Vinnie -- it's me, your uncle Bingo, time to pay the check!  Batman!  BATMAN!  Can somebody please tell me what kind of a world we live in where a man dressed as a bat gets my airtime!? This city needs an enema!  Have we shipped a million of these things? Ship it all.  Untangle the knots, roll the wheels, I've got my blood up! Losing is a bad habit, Bob.  So much to do and so little time. Who's this dud? Bad tie.  No style. Stop the press!!  Who is that? She's gonna trade up!  Damn!  It's hard to stay inside the lines! I'm gonna get me a NEW girl, Bobbie. I've got a mind to make some mayhem.  Phone book! ... new improved Joker brand. With my secret sauce... SMYLEX!  Let's go to our blind taste test. Ooh.  He's not happy!  He's been using Brand X!  But with new improved Joker brand... ... I get a GRIN -- AGAIN AND AGAIN!! That luscious tan, those ruby lips -- and hair color so natural, only your undertaker knows for sure! Daddy's going to make some art. Okay, everybody, let's broaden our minds. I kinda like this one.  Leave it. I think it's safe to take that off.  You're beautiful. In an old fashioned sort of way. I'm sure we can make you more -- today. Crap.  Crap.  Crap, crap, craaap ... Ahhh.  Now here's good work. The skulls.  The bodies.  You give it all such a glow.  I dunno if it's art, but I like it.  Let me tell you what I've got in mind, Sweetie.  I was in the bathtub one day, when I realized why I was destined for greatness. You know how concerned most people are about appearances.  This is pretty, that is not.  Well, that's all over for me.  In crime the passions ripen fully. Now I DO what others only DREAM of.  I do art, 'til somebody DIES. See???  I'm the world's first fully functioning homicidal artist!!! I want my face on the one-dollar bill!   Look, we mustn't mistake ourselves for regular people.  We're ARTISTS. For instance, let me challenge you with a little piece I did.  Bob, Alicia. You'll make a pictorial record of my work.  You'll be with me in the avant garde.  Oh I'm in trouble now! Well, she's just a sketch really. Alicia!  Come here, have a seat. Show the lady why you wear the mask. You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's been made over in line with my new philosophy.  Now, like me, she's a living work of art.  I'm no Picasso.  You LIKE IT?  A little song... a little dance... and Batman's head upon a lance. Tell me what you know about...  Really, well, what do you think about a little 'you and me'? I am?  I thought I was a Pisces!  C'mon, let's make up.  Here's a flower.  NO!  NO!  I'M MELTING!  I'M MELTING!  OH GOD!  I'M MELTING!  BOO!  Those toys!  Where does he get those wonderful toys?  Well don't just stand there!  GO I have given a name to my pain and it is BAT MAN!!! Bob, you got to possess strength to inflict greater pain!  We got a Bat to kill.  And I want to clean my claws!! Miss me? Well, Ms. Vale, another rooster in the henhouse? Tell me something, my friend, you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight? I ask that question of all my prey before I send a draft through their domes.  I just like the sound of it. Vicki, don't let my happy-go-lucky appearance fool you.  I'm really very upset.  You were dining with me!  Talking art, I was a man who was getting somewhere with a beautiful woman. And then ALL OF A SUDDEN, without a word of apology, you take off with that SIDESHOW PHONY.  I'm only laughing on the outside, my smile is skin deep, if you could see inside I'm really crying you might join me for a weep. Came on I want you to shoot some snaps.  Make me immortal.  It'll be good for you. Looks like they're rethinking their spot in the social order. Listen, Bruce, NEVER rub another man's rhubarb!  Get me? Gotham Square, lickety split.  Slow down, you maniac!  I'm a little high-strung.  Y'know, I've recently had tragedy in my life.  Day before yesterday, Alicia hurled herself out of the window.  Couldn't adjust to my new aesthetic. But you can't make an omelette without breakin' some eggs!  Start shootin', my sweet.  I'm makin' history.  No autographs. What police?  Hi there, fellow Gothamites!  As the NEXT founding father of this fair city, I declare these celebrations well and truly open. My very face destroyed! DAMN!  I got a good one for you, Batman.  What's red and bloody and has no brains? I didn't know Bats came out in the daytime. Aw, can't I keep him?  I'll feed him.  I want a new bicycle, I want to visit Florida, I want... The odds are even.  So I'm a leavin'.  You got your toys -- I got mine. Joker here.  Now you guys have said some pretty mean things.  Some of which I admit were true under that fiend Boss Grissom.  He was a terrorist and a thief.  But on the other hand he was great at Bridge. Anyway he's dead and he left me in charge.  Now I CAN be theatrical, maybe even a bit rough -- but there's one thing I'm not.  I'm I even got a little present for Gotham City.  At midnight I drop crowd.  I've got plenty so don't worry about me.  And there will be entertainment. The BIG FIGHT.  Me in one corner, and in the other, the man who has brought the real terror to this city.  BATMAN.  Can you hear me!  Just you and me. Mano A Mano.  I've taken off my makeup, let's see if you can take off yours. I'm going to the festival.  You really ought to show up.  I'm gonna kill a thousand people an hour until you do. I'm prepared to rule the world!! That's right, folks.  Who can you trust?  Me, I'm here handing out real money.  And where is Batman? He's at home washing his tights!  Ah wing-ed battle flies through the night and finds me READY!  Bob, mask!  Now comes part where I relieve you, the little people, of the burden of your failed and useless lives. But as my plastic surgeon always said, when you got to go, go with a SMILE! My balloons!  Those are my balloons!  Wage war you BASTARDS! It's just cookin' good, you SCHMOES!  What's going ON? Come to me you gruesome son of a bitch!!! Gotham Cathedral tower.  It's getting crowded down here.  Come and get me in five minutes. Better make it ten. I must have belled the bat! There ain't any more of you up here, are there? -- Daddy or Momma bat? You climbed up the outside with a rope!  You little monkey!  God, look at you.  You're a mess.  They're gonna be real mad at the costume shop when they see what you did to their suit. You maniac, it was you who dropped me in the tanks.  You made me. What is this?  I say you made me and you have to say I made you? How childish can you get?  You're insane.  Step on it.  I'll be on the roof.  That was dumb.  Now I'm going to have to operate. I saved the last dance for you. 
--is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there? Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes. Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days. Yeah, I   mean, it's different each day, so   I really like that. I don't think I   could ever work in an office.   Behind a desk.  Everyday.  I'm sorry. Did I bring what? Yes ma'am. I've been using it as a journal, but also a joke diary. Funny thoughts or, or observations-- Did I tell you I'm pursuing a career in stand-up comedy? I think I did. Right. I didn't realize you wanted to read it. Yeah. I mean, that's just-- No. I just,-- some of it's personal. You know? She has good days. But mostly bad. It's been a big help having me there. She really needs me.  Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I was in the hospital, after my last episode-- she was having trouble getting over there to visit. Yeah, I was wondering if you could ask the doctor to increase the dosage on my medications? Nothing seems to make a difference.  Some. She glances at his file again. I just don't wanna feel so bad anymore. I wasn't bothering her, I was-- It's day to day. I'm doing everything I can to get her back on her feet.  Picked up her medicine. Gonna make her some dinner.  Hey Sophie-- She turns around. I'll tell my mom you said hello. She smiles as in "yeah, that's what I said." Old apartment, worn carpet. Nothing's new inside but it's fairly neat and well-kept. Joker closes the door behind him, leans his back against it and swoons. Hears a deep purring sound. He looks down and sees an OLD ORANGE CAT, rubbing up against his leg. Then-- Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter. Yes I'm sure. And my head's right here. I'm gonna make you some dinner, okay? He's a busy man. Ma, eat. You need to eat. Maybe you shouldn't watch so much television.  Everybody who? Who do you talk to? Stop it. He's not even gonna run. Why would Thomas Wayne want to be mayor? He can do more good as a businessman. He will. Now eat some dinner. How you feeling today?  Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a werewolf? What? Why? Who tips their mailman? Okay. I can try his office. Tomorrow. Hello. I have a personal letter for Mr. Thomas Wayne. It's kind of important. I need to make sure he gets it himself. Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to years. She was their housekeeper. A couple other business people are now waiting behind Joker, there for meetings. Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe at least call back to him? Tell him that I'm here. Okay. Well, can I have your name? So I know who I left it with. Now Joker sees a GROUP OF MEN walking behind the glass that separates the reception area from the back offices. Amongst tan, hair dyed so black it's almost blue. Wait. He's right there.  Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne. He starts banging on the glass... but the group keeps moving. Not noticing him. It was just a bunch of kids. I should have left it alone.  My mother says that the people nowadays lack empathy. It means like "feeling for other people." Kind of. But different. I, I don't have the money for this, Randall. What for? Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to see me? Not quite. Haven't even performed yet. Just been working my material. This business is all about fine- tuning. Now Hoyt looks up. Takes a drag from his cigarette. No. I got jumped. I told you about that.  I don't have his sign. And Joker just stares at Hoyt, some blood forming on his forehead-- They wouldn't let me see him.  But they promised me it would get to him. Look up. She tilts her head back and he rinses her hair with the water from the container... Why are these letters so important to you, Ma? What do you think he's gonna do? Help us how? ago. What makes you think he would help you? She looks at him with conviction. I don't want you worrying about money. Everyone's been telling me they think my stand-up is ready for the big clubs. It's just a matter of time before I get a break. She steps into the towel. He's helping dry her off. What do you mean? What?! He quickly turns up the TV volume. REALLY LOUD. Shoves the still smoking gun under the couch cushions. I'M WATCHING AN OLD WAR MOVIE. I know. The Americans are really giving it to the Japs. He walks over to her in the darkness. Kisses her on the forehead.  I'm sorry. I'll turn it down. Joker is writing in his journal. He speaks softly to himself as he writes... Why didn't Randall tell me the gun was loaded? He's my friend. With my luck, I could have killed someone.  I could have killed myself.  I should have killed myself.  I should kill myself. Beat. Hello. I'd like to open an account. She looks up. Oh, hi. That's weird.  I didn't know you worked at a bank. Very glamorous. Look at this place. I'm a comedian. I do stand-up comedy. Yeah. You know, I'm always making funny observations. Always on the look out for my next bit-- so it makes sense. I said hi to my mom. Last week. You said to say hi to my mom. I did. Made her day.  Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you as well, Miss. Joker walks back to the wall by the forms. He fumbles around for a minute, clearly not there to open an account. He begins filling out a form. Then--  If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet. Joker and the kids stomp and sing along. If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet.  If you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it, if you're happy and you know it stomp your feet. As the song winds down, the KIDS and NURSES clap. Joker takes an exaggerated and ridiculous bow-- pants and slides across the floor. Everyone stops. Looks at the gun on the floor. Joker is on a payphone in the lobby of the hospital. He's in his street clothes, wig in his hand, clown-face still painted on.  Hoyt, let me explain.  It was, it was a prop gun. It's part of my act now.  Randall told you that?  Hoyt--  Say what?  --I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.  I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.  Please. Don't. Nothing. I have a condition-- No. It's just my stuff. I don't have anything. Hi. Do you like to laugh? Water dripping, white grease paint running off his face-- Remember how I told you that I'm a stand-up comedian?  Hi. How are you? Beat. Joker enters his building with great urgency. No time for the elevator, he takes the stairs. Two at a time. He races up the stairwell. When he gets to his floor, instead of making a left toward his apartment-- He makes a right, toward Sophie's. He stops at her door. Out of breath. Knocks. He hears footsteps. Quickly pulls the folded-up flyer out of his pocket. The peephole in the door goes dark and then light again. He hears locks unlocking. Sophie opens the door halfway-- Joker looks down at his feet-- Hi. Do you like to laugh?  Remember the other day when I told you about my stand-up comedy. Well, I'm doing a set next Thursday and I'm inviting a bunch of my friends and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come and check it out. Were you crying? Why are you crying? I'm sorry. I, I didn't-- What happened? What for?  Okay. Well, all the info is right there on the flyer. You know they say laughter is the best medicine. Well I didn't think you were going to read it. I lied. Everything bothers me. It's personal. It's my private thoughts. Plus it contains original comedy material that I don't feel comfortable handing over to you. She looks at him and shakes her head. Not in the mood to deal with this. So where will we be meeting? Okay. How am I gonna get my medication? Beat. Why are they talking to him?  -- good evening, hello.  Good to be here.  I, I hated school as a kid. But my mother would always say,--  "You should enjoy it. One day you'll have to work for a living."  "No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!" Dead silence. Except for Joker, who's still cracking up. So, did you laugh? Really couldn't see much from up there. All I heard was my heart pounding. What friends?  Yeah, I decided not to invite them. As a performer sometimes you want to see how a "real" crowd reacts. People who don't already love me, or, or have a notion of who I am, you know? Yeah,-- I don't know how something like that happens. You think?  Hey. You want to get some coffee? I don't know. Not all of them are awful. Take someone like Thomas Wayne for example. He's a hero. Sophie, he's the only one who can save this city. What happened? With your job. At the bank? We don't have to talk about it. Every time.  Every time.  Did you do it? Did you go to bed with him? Right. Wait, what do you mean?  I'm sorry. I have this thing-- I don't know. I read you can get it from a brain injury or, or a lesion in there. My mom said I was born this way. Born laughing. Kind of. That actually started when I was a kid. The other kids made fun of me, called me Happy-- but not in a good way. I got so sick of it, one day when I was about ten, I, I,-- He smiles. I took a razor and cut this smile onto my face.  Sort of like "You want happy? Here, how's this for happy?" He looks down, still smiling. She just watches him for a beat. I've been thinking about this night my whole life. They just sit there for a beat. Quiet. Joker opening the door to his mother's apartment, holding a doggie bag in his hand, sees the flickering blue light of the  "That's life." What is this? How come you never told me? How could you not tell me, Ma?    I'm not yelling! I'm just, excited. How can any of this be real!? How can Thomas Wayne be my father?  Okay. How's this, Mom? Better? Will you please talk to me? Please.  What would they say, Ma? It was a prop gun. And I didn't pull it out, it fell out. Why don't you ask Randall about it? It was his idea. What? ... I don't know anything about it. Randall, I didn't shoot anybody. That wasn't me. And I don't have time for this, I got somebody real important I gotta go see. Joker turns to go--  What? What are you talking about? Randall. Your nose. My name's Arthur. I'm here to see Mr. Wayne-- I, I was just trying to make him laugh. No, please. My mother's name is Penny Fleck. She used to work here, years ago. Can you tell Mr. Wayne that I need to see him? Did you know her? You don't need to cover for them. I'm sure Mrs. Wayne was very upset when she found out. No. No, just let me speak to Mr. Wayne. Now Alfred leans in closer to Joker, almost looks like he feels some pity for him--  Thomas Wayne is my father-- Alfred looks at Joker, and can't help but crack up laughing at him. You did this to her? DET. GARRITY What? No. We just asked her some questions and she started getting hysterical-- hyperventilating, trouble speaking-- then she collapsed. Hit her head pretty hard. They told me she had a stroke. DET. GARRITY Sorry to hear that.  No I,-- I have a, a-- DET. BURKE Okay. But we have some questions for you. DET. GARRITY About those subway killings from a few weeks ago. I don't know anything about that. DET. GARRITY We have an eyewitness who described clown make up. Or a clown mask. Spoke to your boss at Ha-Ha's, Mr. Vaughn, and he said you were on a job the day of the shooting. DET. GARRITY  He also said you got fired that day,-- For bringing a gun into the children's hospital. DET. GARRITY You weren't fired? Not for having a gun. That was prop gun. Part of my act. DET. BURKE So why were you fired? They said I wasn't funny. Joker stands up. Now, if you don't mind, I have to go back and look after my mother. Detective Burke steps close to him, holds up the card that Joker handed him-- DET. BURKE Hey lemme ask you a question? This condition of yours,-- Is this real or is this like some sorta clown thing? Clown thing? DET. BURKE I mean, is it part of your act? What do you think? And Joker walks away-- heads for the sliding glass doors. Only the motion detector doesn't engage-- Excuse me, I was wondering how I could check my mother out of here? One of the nurses at the desk looks up at him, seems slightly annoyed. Penny Fleck. I'd like to take her home. She's not gonna wanna stay that long. She doesn't like hospitals. Or doctors. I don't like hospitals either. Okay. Thanks. Symptoms? Can you tell me what those symptoms are again? Excuse me? No, sorry. Wasn't me. I don't know what you're talking about. If I were you, I'd walk away from this table before I strangle all three of you with that fucking stethoscope hanging from your neck. Beat. Joker crosses a busy street heading to the Center for Performing Arts. Light falling. Storm clouds gathering. Joker stops when he sees-- A CROWD OF PROTESTERS SCREAMING AND SHOUTING IN FRONT OF What? Yeah. No I, I-- Dad. It's me. My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son.  I know you didn't know about me, and I don't want anything from you. Well... maybe a hug. Yes. But they wouldn't let me in, wouldn't let me see you. So I came here. I have so many questions. How do you know? No. What? I wasn't adopted. No. No, I don't believe that.  No, no I have a con-- Sophie? Can I ask you a question? How does someone wind up in here? Have all these people committed crimes?  Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes I don't know what to do, y'know, I don't think I can take any more of this. Last time I ended up taking it out on some,-- people. Bad shit. I thought it would bother me but, it really hasn't. It's just so hard to try and be happy all the time, y'know, when everything's going to shit all around you.  Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was just talking to talk.  So she was a patient here. What? I can handle bad. I've been on a pretty bad run myself. No, wait,-- Sophie, we can get through this, that's why I'm here. I don't know. I mean I've never been with a woman "like that," but, this feels like a beginning to me. You what? What? What kind of woman are you? Who does that?  Why not? No. Don't listen to her GiGi, you need to hear this. Your mother's a bad person. She's a whore, she's seeing two men at once. You can't trust her,-- She'll break your fucking heart. How come nothing ever comes easy for me?  Who is this?  Yes.  Murray wants me to come on the show? Ma, remember how you used to tell me that God gave me this laugh for a reason. That I had a purpose. To bring laughter and joy into this fucked up world,-- She looks at him confused. HA! It wasn't God, it was you or, or one of your boyfriends,-- how could you let that happen? What kind of woman are you? What kind of mother are you? She looks away. What's my real name? Her whole body is shaking, overwhelmed with emotion. C'mon, Ma, I know I was adopted. What's my name? Who am I really? She looks back him, struggles to speak--   But you know what's funny? You know what really makes me laugh? Leans down closer, face-to-face with her-- I used to think my life was nothing but a tragedy, but now, now I realize it's all just a fucking comedy. Other side of the blue divider curtain. We see Joker's feet shifting a little. You wanna hear a joke, Murray? He "waits" for Murray to answer. Then Joker nods okay and opens his notebook--  Knock-knock. His cat still watching him, now at his feet. Joker crosses and uncrosses his legs... Looks uncomfortable. He glances down at his cat. It's as if he can hear the cat talking to him.  Yeah, I don't know if I should cross or uncross 'em. Both feel completely unnatural. Joker gets up off the couch and walks back across the living room. Waves to the "audience"... Mimes shaking Murray's hand... Mimes unbuttoning his coat and sits down... Crosses his legs. Thanks for having me on, Murray. I can't tell you how much this means to me, it's been a life long dream. I have a joke for you-- Joker stands back up. Looks down at the cat again. You're right. You're right, uncrossed is better. Joker sits back down... Doesn't cross his legs this time.  You shouldn't be here. It's not right. DET. GARRITY We just came to pay our respects. Sorry about your mother. DET. BURKE Yeah, it's too bad. Joker just stares at the two detectives. Awkward beat. DET. BURKE Where is everybody? It's always been just me and her. Joker pauses for a moment, then starts to walk away. DET. BURKE  We saw you on Murray Franklin. Joker turns back to them. You saw that? DET. GARRITY Yeah. Heard you were on, so we got a videotape. DET. BURKE I just couldn't tell if you were actually trying to be funny or not. Yeah, well I guess you didn't get the joke. DET. GARRITY Listen, we need to clear a few things up, we spoke to the hospital administrator--  Which hospital? DET. BURKE The Children's Hospital.  The night you were fired. He said it didn't look like a prop gun, it was heavy, like a real one. We have some more questions for you. I just buried my mother. The detectives share a look. Garrity pulls out a card. Hands it to Joker. DET. GARRITY We can do it tomorrow. But you need to come down to the precinct-- first thing in the morning.  Right. Thanks for coming. DET. BURKE Of course. Joker looks back up. That was a joke. We hear applause followed by the familiar opening riff to Is that today? My mom died.  It's not a good time. I'm in the middle of something here.  I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Can you believe it? Gary doesn't answer. Doesn't move-- It's okay, Gary. You can go. Gary backs away toward the door. Joker sits there for a moment, breathing heavy, wipes Randall's blood off his face--  Murray, I can't believe this is real, that I'm really here. Are you kidding? Thank you for the opportunity. I've been watching you forever. My mother never missed a show. No, I don't believe in any of that. I don't believe in anything. I just thought it would be good for my act. No. I hadn't heard. Thank you Murray. Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When you bring me out, can you introduce me as "The Joker"? Honestly, I don't even know what my real name is. Besides, that's what you called me on the show, Murray. A joker. Remember?  Yeah. Isn't it great? Joker just keeps cracking up. Audience still isn't sure what to make of him. There's some awkward laughter. Nobody's laughing in the booth.  That's right. I'm not political, Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to make people laugh.  Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.  I want to get it right. Knock knock.  It's the police, ma'am. Your son has been hit by a drunk driver. He's dead. The associate producer tries not to laugh, but she can't help it. The director looks over at her like she's lost her mind. That's right, Murray. But she's dead now. The audience laughs. Yeah. She is. Murray's not sure if this is part of his act. I don't know who my father is, Murray. Turns out I was adopted and sexually assaulted by my mother's boyfriend. DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN Ahhhh! No, no,-- You can not joke about that.  Sorry. It's been a rough few months, Murray. I mean, after my mother died, the police came to question me at her funeral. Who does that? Very funny, Murray. No, they came because I killed those three Wall Street guys. Studio audience can't tell if he's joking or not. Murray can't either. There is no punchline. It's not a joke. The director stares at the monitor.  I got nothing left to lose, Murray. Nothing can hurt me anymore. This is my fate, it was always my fate. My life is nothing but a comedy. Sophie's sitting on her couch watching this interview play out on TV. GiGi's asleep next to her. The open envelope and the money are lying on the coffee table. No sign of the flowers anywhere. C'mon, Murray, do I look like the kind of clown who could start a movement? I killed those guys because they were awful. Everybody's awful these days. It's enough to make anyone crazy. No. They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives. Why is everyone so upset about these guys? Because Thomas Wayne went and cried about them on TV? Yeah. I do. Everything comes so easy for him. Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray? Do you ever actually leave the studio? Everybody just yells and screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy. You think men like Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever think what it's like to be a guy like me? To be anybody but themselves.  They don't. They think we'll all just sit there and take it like good little boys. That we won't werewolf and go wild. Well, this is for all of you out there. You're awful, Murray. There is no more laughter. The audience is watching this exchange with full attention. Playing my video, inviting me on the show,-- You just wanted to make fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh at Frankenstein on a crowded beach, isn't it? You're just like the rest of them, Murray. Everything comes too easy for you. How about another joke, Murray? What do you get when you cross a mentally-ill loner with a system that abandons him and treats him like trash? Murray pauses for a minute, not really listening to Joker, suddenly realizing the seriousness of the situation. He starts to turn to camera--  I'll tell you what you get. You get what you fucking deserve,-- And as Murray Franklin turns back to him, JOKER SHOOTS THE -- just thinking of this joke. No. Because it's personal, it's between me and him.  ... Good. Everything's good now.  Yeah. How I remember it.  Gotham City.  It always brings a smile to my face. Watch it, Batman.  Wait'll they get a load of me. You wouldn't believe what happened to me today. Because life's been good to me. Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands... and that's it. Yeah. Carmine got a little hot under the collar.  Haven't you heard of the healing power of laughter? Now GET OUT OF HERE -- And give it some thought. Bob, I want you to take a camera and follow this reporter Knox. Find out what he knows about Batman.  You got to learn to USE people, Bob. Your pals, they're not such bad guys.  What d'you say we give 'em a couple of days to come round?  No?  Grease 'em now?  Okay.  You're a vicious bastard, Rotelli. I'm glad you're dead.  Hello, Vinnie -- it's me, your uncle Bingo, time to pay the check!  Batman!  BATMAN!  Can somebody please tell me what kind of a world we live in where a man dressed as a bat gets my airtime!? This city needs an enema!  Have we shipped a million of these things? Ship it all.  Untangle the knots, roll the wheels, I've got my blood up! Losing is a bad habit, Bob.  So much to do and so little time. Who's this dud? Bad tie.  No style. Stop the press!!  Who is that? She's gonna trade up!  Damn!  It's hard to stay inside the lines! I'm gonna get me a NEW girl, Bobbie. I've got a mind to make some mayhem.  Phone book! ... new improved Joker brand. With my secret sauce... SMYLEX!  Let's go to our blind taste test. Ooh.  He's not happy!  He's been using Brand X!  But with new improved Joker brand... ... I get a GRIN -- AGAIN AND AGAIN!! That luscious tan, those ruby lips -- and hair color so natural, only your undertaker knows for sure! Daddy's going to make some art. Okay, everybody, let's broaden our minds. I kinda like this one.  Leave it. I think it's safe to take that off.  You're beautiful. In an old fashioned sort of way. I'm sure we can make you more -- today. Crap.  Crap.  Crap, crap, craaap ... Ahhh.  Now here's good work. The skulls.  The bodies.  You give it all such a glow.  I dunno if it's art, but I like it.  Let me tell you what I've got in mind, Sweetie.  I was in the bathtub one day, when I realized why I was destined for greatness. You know how concerned most people are about appearances.  This is pretty, that is not.  Well, that's all over for me.  In crime the passions ripen fully. Now I DO what others only DREAM of.  I do art, 'til somebody DIES. See???  I'm the world's first fully functioning homicidal artist!!! I want my face on the one-dollar bill!   Look, we mustn't mistake ourselves for regular people.  We're ARTISTS. For instance, let me challenge you with a little piece I did.  Bob, Alicia. You'll make a pictorial record of my work.  You'll be with me in the avant garde.  Oh I'm in trouble now! Well, she's just a sketch really. Alicia!  Come here, have a seat. Show the lady why you wear the mask. You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's been made over in line with my new philosophy.  Now, like me, she's a living work of art.  I'm no Picasso.  You LIKE IT?  A little song... a little dance... and Batman's head upon a lance. Tell me what you know about...  Really, well, what do you think about a little 'you and me'? I am?  I thought I was a Pisces!  C'mon, let's make up.  Here's a flower.  NO!  NO!  I'M MELTING!  I'M MELTING!  OH GOD!  I'M MELTING!  BOO!  Those toys!  Where does he get those wonderful toys?  Well don't just stand there!  GO I have given a name to my pain and it is BAT MAN!!! Bob, you got to possess strength to inflict greater pain!  We got a Bat to kill.  And I want to clean my claws!! Miss me? Well, Ms. Vale, another rooster in the henhouse? Tell me something, my friend, you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight? I ask that question of all my prey before I send a draft through their domes.  I just like the sound of it. Vicki, don't let my happy-go-lucky appearance fool you.  I'm really very upset.  You were dining with me!  Talking art, I was a man who was getting somewhere with a beautiful woman. And then ALL OF A SUDDEN, without a word of apology, you take off with that SIDESHOW PHONY.  I'm only laughing on the outside, my smile is skin deep, if you could see inside I'm really crying you might join me for a weep. Came on I want you to shoot some snaps.  Make me immortal.  It'll be good for you. Looks like they're rethinking their spot in the social order. Listen, Bruce, NEVER rub another man's rhubarb!  Get me? Gotham Square, lickety split.  Slow down, you maniac!  I'm a little high-strung.  Y'know, I've recently had tragedy in my life.  Day before yesterday, Alicia hurled herself out of the window.  Couldn't adjust to my new aesthetic. But you can't make an omelette without breakin' some eggs!  Start shootin', my sweet.  I'm makin' history.  No autographs. What police?  Hi there, fellow Gothamites!  As the NEXT founding father of this fair city, I declare these celebrations well and truly open. My very face destroyed! DAMN!  I got a good one for you, Batman.  What's red and bloody and has no brains? I didn't know Bats came out in the daytime. Aw, can't I keep him?  I'll feed him.  I want a new bicycle, I want to visit Florida, I want... The odds are even.  So I'm a leavin'.  You got your toys -- I got mine. Joker here.  Now you guys have said some pretty mean things.  Some of which I admit were true under that fiend Boss Grissom.  He was a terrorist and a thief.  But on the other hand he was great at Bridge. Anyway he's dead and he left me in charge.  Now I CAN be theatrical, maybe even a bit rough -- but there's one thing I'm not.  I'm I even got a little present for Gotham City.  At midnight I drop crowd.  I've got plenty so don't worry about me.  And there will be entertainment. The BIG FIGHT.  Me in one corner, and in the other, the man who has brought the real terror to this city.  BATMAN.  Can you hear me!  Just you and me. Mano A Mano.  I've taken off my makeup, let's see if you can take off yours. I'm going to the festival.  You really ought to show up.  I'm gonna kill a thousand people an hour until you do. I'm prepared to rule the world!! That's right, folks.  Who can you trust?  Me, I'm here handing out real money.  And where is Batman? He's at home washing his tights!  Ah wing-ed battle flies through the night and finds me READY!  Bob, mask!  Now comes part where I relieve you, the little people, of the burden of your failed and useless lives. But as my plastic surgeon always said, when you got to go, go with a SMILE! My balloons!  Those are my balloons!  Wage war you BASTARDS! It's just cookin' good, you SCHMOES!  What's going ON? Come to me you gruesome son of a bitch!!! Gotham Cathedral tower.  It's getting crowded down here.  Come and get me in five minutes. Better make it ten. I must have belled the bat! There ain't any more of you up here, are there? -- Daddy or Momma bat? You climbed up the outside with a rope!  You little monkey!  God, look at you.  You're a mess.  They're gonna be real mad at the costume shop when they see what you did to their suit. You maniac, it was you who dropped me in the tanks.  You made me. What is this?  I say you made me and you have to say I made you? How childish can you get?  You're insane.  Step on it.  I'll be on the roof.  That was dumb.  Now I'm going to have to operate. I saved the last dance for you.
